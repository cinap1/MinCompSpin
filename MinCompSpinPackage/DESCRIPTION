Description: An interface for the original C++ based program MinCompSpin.
      This program allows to uncover AND model community structures in binary data, 
      while taking into account possible high order patterns of data in the 
      detection of the communities (i.e., possible high-order correlations between the variables). 
      The idea of the algorithm is based on performing statistical inference 
      with a family of spin models (maximum entropy models for binary data) 
      that have minimal information theoretic complexity. 
      These models are called Minimally Complex Models (MCM). 
      The selected model can be used as a generative model for data. This package 
      is good for use on small systems, typically with <~15 variables
      per binary data-point. Note that for ~15 variables, it may take several 
      days to perform the exhaustive search since the number of possible models
      grows exponentially with the number of variables.
